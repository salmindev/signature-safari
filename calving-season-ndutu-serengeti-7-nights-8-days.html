          Experience the first steps of one of nature’s most grueling and
          fascinating journeys as you witness the Calving Season Ndutu
          Serengeti. A new year brings new beginnings and this Tanzanian Calving
          Season Package perfectly sums up this saying. This adventure not only
          offers the chance to witness the arrival of the new members of the
          massive wildebeest herds that are part of the Great Migration but also
          to see the opportunist predators waiting to prey on it – a definite
          must for those who love seeing dramatic scenes unfold! Seven days of
          wildlife wonders and unimaginable adventures, as we set out from
          Arusha and concentrate our safari first on magical Ndutu and then
          Serengeti – the jewel of Tanzania – before enjoying a completely
          different, though equally amazing, setting at Ngorongoro. These
          unmissable locations will get us up close to a host of animals:
          Wildebeest and Zebra, lion and cheetah, elephants and buffalo, plus
          many, many more as well as fascinating birdlife. Beautiful Tanzania
          will unveil itself before your very eyes, with highlight after
          highlight.

                        Today, your adventure begins after breakfast at your
                        hotel. We’re driving north and west, introducing you to
                        the wonders of the Tanzanian landscapes as we head for
                        Ndutu in the south-eastern part of the Serengeti. Our
                        drive today is around 280km, five hours of changing
                        scenery before we arrive at our destination. Although
                        Nature and its rainfall determine exactly where the
                        migrating animals will be in winter, Ndutu is a reliable
                        base at this time of the year, allowing us to maximize
                        our opportunities for tracking the animals.During the
                        journey to Ndutu, you will begin to appreciate the sheer
                        scale of Tanzania’s territory. The raw beauty of the
                        landscapes will reveal itself. Your driver-guide will
                        help you to spot any animals and birds on the way and
                        answer any questions about what you see. Serengeti is of
                        course a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an incredible mix
                        of grasslands, savannah, woods and mountain scenery, a
                        haven for the wildlife which congregates in this
                        fantastic natural setting. On arrival, we make the most
                        of our time with an afternoon game drive in the Ndutu
                        area. After today’s journey and game-drive, your driver
                        will take you safely to your accommodation for your
                        overnight stay.Dinner and overnight are at the beautiful
                        Serengeti Heritage Tented Lodge Serengeti for dinner and
                        overnight.

                        Having had a taster the previous afternoon, today you
                        have the whole day ahead of you in the Ndutu area after
                        breakfast, spotting all varieties of wildlife ‘on the
                        move’ with your expert driver-guide. Each day is
                        different here, but we focus of course on the Great
                        Migration, that unique natural wonder which involves a
                        cast of breathtaking numbers, literally hundreds of
                        thousands of animals as they make their annual journey
                        across the plains.Zebra and wildebeest are the most
                        numerous of the migrating animals here, grazing on the
                        short-grass plains of the Southern Serengeti and the
                        northern part of the Ngorongoro Conservation area. But
                        your driver-guide will also be on the lookout for other
                        wildlife, too, using his expertise and ‘eagle-eyes’ to
                        try to find elephant, lions, buffalo, leopard and
                        cheetah – just some of the many, many species you will
                        encounter in this stunning place.At the end of the
                        afternoon, it’s back to your accommodation for a cool
                        drink, some relaxation, a delicious dinner and the
                        chance to discuss what you’ve seen during the day’s

                        Today our journey continues as we head from the edge of
                        the Serengeti into its very heart…but not before we
                        seize a final opportunity for a morning game drive
                        around Ndutu, where we are sure to see something new.
                        But now Serengeti beckons, and so we continue to head
                        north and west into what is surely the world’s greatest
                        park.At times this unsurpassable place is home to over
                        1.6 million herbivores and the thousands of predators
                        who stalk them. Their fascinating habits and habitats
                        are sure to provoke questions, so do ask your
                        driver-guide to explain the amazing creatures you see
                        all around you. At night, back at your accommodation,
                        the sights, sounds and smells of Africa will continue to
                        enchant you on this wilderness adventure.Dinner and

                        Waking up in the Serengeti is something really special.
                        Sights, sounds and smells of Africa are all around us,
                        and ahead is a full day of adventure in the world’s most
                        famous national park. After breakfast, we start today
                        Calving Season Ndutu Serengeti with the morning section
                        of our game drive in Serengeti National Park, marvelling
                        at the stunning scenery, ever changing light and always
                        entertaining wildlife, all explained to you by your
                        expert driver-guide.After our picnic lunch, we set off
                        again, searching for wildlife in this awe-inspiring
                        park. Serengeti’s wonders evolve subtly as the day
                        progresses. The myriad animals and birds are the ‘stars
                        of the show’ and Nature’s dramas can unfold at any time.
                        Of course, the animals don’t work to any schedule, so we
                        may find lion or leopard, elephant and zebra, cheetah
                        and antelope at any time on our drives. At the end of
                        the afternoon, we return to the camp for dinner and some
                        much needed rest.

                        You may want to sit down with the Maasai women and learn
                        how to create the intricate beadwork they have become
                        well-known for. The tedious technique—and the ease with
                        which they string the beads together—is a testament to
                        this tradition’s importance. Or, join the Maasai men as
                        they tend to their livestock, and perhaps help them move
                        their cattle to and from the grazing field.We will also
                        have the opportunity to try on the vibrantly-colored,
                        traditional Maasai dress, and join in on a dance
                        celebration. You will hear chanting, rhythmic drumming,
                        and shared laughter—there’s nothing quite like dancing
                        to break the ice across cultures. As you partake, notice
                        how the Maasai women bob their necks, causing their
                        beaded jewelry to do a dance of their own. And, watch as
                        the Maasai men show off their famous jumping.Then, we
                        will participate in an intimate Q&A session with the
                        village elders. This is a great opportunity to truly get
                        to know the tribes people, asking questions about family
                        dynamics, tribal medicine and healing techniques, their
                        thoughts about technology, and more. Ngorongoro Rhino
                        Lodge, situated only a few hundred meters from the
                        crater’s rim, offers a perfect base to explore the
                        Ngorongoro Crater and its surroundings.

                        It is up at daybreak to take on the steep path after
                        breakfast leading down into the 600 m deep crater with
                        packed picnic lunch. The slopes are forested but soon
                        the landscape changes to savannah with the occasional
                        acacia tree here and there. The wildlife in the crater
                        is just breath-taking and with a little luck you might
                        see the Big Five – lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino and
                        leopard. You should also see warthogs, wildebeests,
                        zebras, hippos and some of the more than 500 bird
                        species of the area.The Ngorongoro Crater in Northern
                        Tanzania, once a gigantic volcano, is the largest intact
                        caldera in the world. Some maintain that before it
                        erupted, it would have been higher than Mt Kilimanjaro,
                        the highest peak in Africa.Animals in Ngorongoro were
                        just trapped after descending down to the crater and
                        could not come out again and this made them multiply
                        within the crater. Currently all the African big 5 can
                        be seen in Ngorongoro crater like the black Rhinos,
                        Elephants, Lions, Buffalo and Leopards.
